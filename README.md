To classify the vallon de l'Orgere (Vanoise National Park) - to determine the landscapes described per square metre - we used three main tools: orthophotos, LiDAR and satellite images. 

The orthophotos we use have a resolution of 0.2 (1 pixel equals to 0.2 meter), making them a fine, high-performance tool for defining landscape structure. LiDAR is an active remote sensing system that enables us to determine the height of objects and excels at distinguishing low, medium and high vegetation. The NDVI index calculated from satellite images is an excellent index of plant biomass and an interesting spatio-temporal indicator.
